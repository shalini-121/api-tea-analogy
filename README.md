# APIs Explained with a Cup of Tea ☕

This project is a fun, beginner-friendly explanation of APIs using a tea stall analogy.

🧠 Instead of technical jargon, I built this using pure HTML and CSS — turning the concept into a visual story that's easy to understand and enjoyable to read.

## 🔍 What This Includes:
- An HTML/CSS slide deck (like a mini presentation)
- A downloadable PDF version for carousel posting
- A storytelling-based explanation of:
  - Clients
  - Servers
  - API documentation
  - Request/response
  - Real-world usage
